All AND operators are evaluated before OR operators. Let's look at an example of an ambiguous case. Type: 5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9

> 5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9
[1] TRUE

which(c(1,3,5,4,3)>4) gives me the index of vector that match the condition
[1] 3

any(c(1,3,4,5,3)>4) gives me TRUE if any component of vector meets the condition

all(c(1,3,4,5,3)>0) gives me TRUE if all component of vector meets the condition
