We have two type of vectors: atomic vectors (one class only) and lists.

Atomic vectors can have 5 classes: numeric,logical, character, integer, and complex

Logical can contain T, F, NA, and they are the result of logical conditions



my_char<-c("My","name","is")

"My"   "name" "is"

paste(my_char, collapse = " ")
[1] "My name is"

paste("Hello", "world!", sep=" ")
